# Autonomous waiter

The Autonomous Waiter Project is designed to showcase the implementation of artificial intelligence in solving the problem of serving customers in a restaurant. The waiter proposes a dish to the customer, and once the customer finishes eating, the waiter recognizes the empty plate and takes it away. The waiter moves by taking the shortest possible route while considering the terrain.
